## Intent

Our focus was to bring a tone of innovation by developing an easy to use bedside based Smart Clock with weather and automatic lamp functionalities, configurable via a user-friendly GUI. The former is convenient to save oneâ€™s time taken to prepare in the mornings and the latter ideal for home energy saving purposes. Our model aims at removing the ambiguity associated with current Smart Clocks by providing only features we believe are the most useful.

Smart Clock to implement clock, lamp and weather functionalities, all displayed by means of LED technology. Time and weather information are displayed on a 32 x 64 LED matrix panel. The information displayed on the LED matrix panel comprises local time (in 24 hour format), outdoor temperature, weather icon associated with the outdoor temperature of the location set by the user, and indoor temperature of humidity. Settings such as color of various text on the LED matrix panel, time interval to query server and and brightness of the lamp are all adjustable through our provided Smart Clock GUI. The lamp feature is accessible via a LED ring located on top of the Smart Clock. The role of this lamp, from an energy saving perspective, is to automatically turn on and off based on the 
brightness of the room in which it is located. The LED ring/lamp provides a level of brightness that is capable of lightning an entire room, given it is equipped with the appropriate type of light reflection matter.
